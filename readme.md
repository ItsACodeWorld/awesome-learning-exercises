# Awesome Learning Exercises 
This repo contains the source code for the Awesome Learning platform. These sub-folders are picked up by the CodeSandbox.io GitHub wizard and turned in to on-the-fly CodeSandbox instances. 

## Git Wizard Process
The CodeSandbox wizard works by pulling the source code from the specified link and bootstrapping a new CodeSandbox instance with it. Check out the docs [here](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing#import-from-github)

In the Awesome Learning platform repo, we link to the CodeSandbox git endpoint. When a user clicks the link within the session, CodeSandbox stands up an on the fly instance for them. 

The CodeSandbox endpoint works by pre-pending your username and repo link with `https://codesandbox.io/s/github/`. If your lesson is nested within the awesome learning exercises repo, it would look something like this.    

```
endpoint link: `https://codesandbox.io/s/github/`    

lesson deeplink: `/wayfair/awesome-learning-exercises/tree/master/data-types/types-and-equality`   

combined link in the repo: `https://codesandbox.io/s/github/wayfair/awesome-learning-exercises/tree/master/data-types/types-and-equality`
```

Clicking on the above combined link will open the CodeSandbox with the bootstrapped code from that part of the exercises repo. 

## Repo Structure
You don't have to npm install anything. This isn't meant to be used as a standalone entity. 

Because this repo is meant only to be a source for CodeSandboxes, it must follow a few guidelines though -

### Guiding Principles 
When adding a new lesson, it should:
1. Include a `package.json` at the top level of each lesson folder. 
    - The CodeSandbox git wizard requires an accessible `package.json` when open a nested link, which all lesson links will be.
2. Include all required dependencies for your particular repo in each lesson `package.json`
3. Include suggested solutions to all exercises

### Repo Structure 
We follow the rough structure of 
```
├── course-name
│   ├── lesson-name-1
│   ├── lesson-name-2
│   ├── etc....
```
This manifests as something like this: 
```
├── array-methods
│   ├── advanced-reduce
│   ├── filter-and-map
│   ├── forEach
│   ├── reduce
│   └── sort
├── async-patterns
│   ├── advanced-promises
│   └── intro-to-promises
├── data-types
│   ├── objects
│   └── types-and-equality
├── functions-and-scope
│   ├── closures
│   ├── context-and-arrows
│   └── scope
├── testing
|   ├── components-and-enzyme
|   └── intro-to-unit-testing
├── readme.md
└── package.json
```

### Example Lesson Structure With Jest Tests
Within each lesson directory should be all the files required to build a working CodeSandbox instance. 

**NOTE:** For the CodeSandbox GitHub wizard to work, you will need a package.json file at the top level of your lesson folder. 

Example "types and equality" lesson under the "data-types" course directory
```
├── data-types
│   └── types-and-equality
│       ├── package.json
│       └── src
│           ├── exercises
│           │   └── __tests__
│           │       ├── 1-types.test.js
│           │       ├── 2-equality.test.js
│           │       └── 3-practical-types-and-equality.test.js
│           └── solutions
│               ├── 1-solution.js
│               ├── 2-solution.js
│               └── 3-solution.js
```

#### A quick word about Jest
If you are relying on jest tests, test files must be contained within a `__tests__` folder nested underneath a `src` directory or CodeSandbox will not transpile the files correctly, and global Jest variables will not be in scope. This is a known issue for CodeSandbox and will hopefully be resolved soon. 

#### Example package.json for a lesson
```
{
  "name": "awesome-learning-[course-name]-[lesson-name]",
  "description": "Awesome Learning: [Course Name]: [Lesson Name] Exercises",
  "dependencies": {
    "jest": "24.1.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/jest": "23.3.13",
    "jest": "23.6.0"
  }
}
```

## Lesson Formatting

We use template strings and emojis to denote comments and directions within our lesson files

```
Lesson Introduction
------------------------------------------------
⬇️ = Indicates the beginning of the lesson description block
⬆️ = Indicates the end of the lesson description block 

Example: 
`
	⬇️
	
	Welcome to <Session Name - Blah Blah>
	
	This will do things and other things
	
	⬆️
`
------------------------------------------------


Exercise Description
------------------------------------------------
	📚 = Brackets an exercise title

Example: 

	`📚 Exercise 1 - Let's write a promise 📚`

------------------------
🛠️ = Denotes the exercise task

Example: 

	`🛠️ Fill in the getUserBasket function below.  
   🛠️ This function should take a user id and resolve with
   🛠️ an array of their basket items if they have any,
  `
------------------------
💡 = Denotes a tip, trick, or hint

Example: 

  `💡 fetchBasket returns an object in this shape:
	  {
	    customerId: string,
	    name: string,
	    items: array
	  }
   `
------------------------

🚨 = Denotes a warning, callout, something that may trip people up

Example: 

	`🚨 This will require you to call getUserBasket`

------------------------------------------------


Example Exercise: 
------------------------------------------------
`
📚 Exercise 5 - Implement getBasketItems 📚
 
  Now that we can fetch a basketId given a userId,
  we need a way to fetch baskets.
 
  Luckily we have a promise-based function called fetchBasket
  which takes in a basketId, hits an endpoint, and returns a basket
  object if one matches the basketId provided.
 
  🛠️ Fill in the getBasketItems function below
  🛠️ It should take in a basketId string, 
  🛠️ call the fetchBasket endpoint with basketId.
  🛠️ If items exists on the response object, resolve with the items array.
  🛠️ If items doesn't exist on the response object, resolve with an empty array
 
  💡 fetchBasket returns an object in this shape:
  {
    customerId: string,
    name: string,
    items: array
  }
`;

Welcome to Async Js- Intro to promises!

 This will build your knowledge of async JS -
 particularly promises. You will use to two mock APIs
 to mimic working with something like a fetch or AJAX call.

 If you are curious about those fake APIs, feel free to
 check them out in the ../api folder.

📚 Exercise 1 - Let's write a promise 📚

🛠️ Inside the exerciseOne block, return a new promise.
🛠️ This promise should resolve with the string
🛠️ 'promise complete!' after a delay of 100ms.

`;

const exerciseOne = () => {
  // Your code here
};

test('the promise resolves with a string of "promise complete!"', () => {
  return expect(exerciseOne()).resolves.toBe("promise complete!");

📚 Exercise 2 - Rejected! 📚 

🛠️ Return a new promise from the exerciseTwo block.
🛠️ This promise should reject with the string
🛠️ 'promise rejected!' after a delay of 100ms.
